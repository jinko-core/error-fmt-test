# error-fmt-test

This project is an attempt at deciding which format to use for errors in the
[jinko programming language](https://github.com/jinko-core/jinko).

Using a dummy error, we can try out multiple configurations by editing the main
rust file of this project.

# Try it out

`$ cargo run --quiet`

# Contributing

You are more than welcome to try out different styles and contribute them
through a pull request.
